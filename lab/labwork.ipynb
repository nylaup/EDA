    "## EDA LAB\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, I chose to explore whether a person's household (currently or when growing up) is correlated with their views of trust and safety in the world. I included some demographic variables, just to see what impact those might have had on the variables I was looking at, those being year, age, sex, and race. For household I chose to look at happiness of marriage, marital status, number of children, strength of religious affiliation, number of persons in household, and number of family generations in household. To test trust, I found two variables of trust and fairness. Without much prior research, it is hard to say what I would expect to see from these results, but I think it is interesting to see what factors in someone's household may make them more trusting or believe there is less fairness in the world.
